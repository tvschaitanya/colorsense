# ColorSense ðŸŽ¨

**ColorSense** is an AI-powered web application that transforms text descriptions of colors into visual representations with accurate hex codes and descriptions.

## What is ColorSense?

ColorSense bridges the gap between natural language and color visualization. Ever tried describing a specific color to someone? "It's like a sunset orange, but more muted" or "A warm taupe with hints of pink" - ColorSense understands these descriptions and converts them into actual colors you can see and use in your projects.

**Key Features:**

- Convert natural language color descriptions to visual colors with hex codes
- Process multiple colors at once (separated by new lines, bullet points, or commas)
- Beautiful, responsive UI with smooth animations
- Display color name, hex code, and a brief description for each color

## Why ColorSense?

ColorSense was created to solve several practical problems:

1. **Design Communication** - Helps designers and clients communicate color preferences more intuitively
2. **Accessibility** - Allows people to visualize colors described in text
3. **Creative Exploration** - Enables experimentation with color palettes using natural language
4. **Education** - Teaches the relationship between color descriptions and visual representations

## Tech Stack

ColorSense is built with modern web technologies:

- **Next.js 15.3.0** - React framework with App Router
- **React 19.0.0** - UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
